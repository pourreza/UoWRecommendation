The nested workflow 'NestedProcessor' is called that to conform to Tom's explanation. For an alternative solution using a java beanshell to clone list items see 'TestIteratorStrategy_withCloning. This workflow implements the following Q&A;: Marco Roos wrote: &gt; Dear Taverna user,&gt;&gt; Issue 1: Complex iteration&gt;&gt;     I would like to perform an iteration including a dot product between&gt;     a list and a list of lists; example: &gt;     Input: &gt;&gt;         [1]&gt;         [A,B,C]&gt;         [[a,b],[c,d],[e,f]]&gt;&gt;     Desired output: &gt;&gt;         [1Aa, 1Ab, 1Bc, 1Bd, 1Ce, 1Cf]&gt;&gt;     Is this possible? If so, how can I achieve this? Yes, but not directly. This is actually the reason for the new T2 feature called 'staged iteration'. The issue is that assuming you iterate down to single items (which appears to be the case) you want to go half way with a dot product and then use a cross product. As the iteration strategies always (in the current code) drill down to the final thing you're asking for you can't do this, at least you can't do it without a trick... So... the trick : First off the [1] is a red herring, that's the easy bit! it doesn't matter where you put that in as it'll always be added onto every single job. So you now have a list and a list of lists, you want to combine item 'n' in the first list with all the items of list 'n' in the second. Firstly you'll need a nested workflow into which you put your processor, the trick being that you also put in an 'echo list' operation. Connect the echo list output to the input of your processor being fed needing the list of lists and the echo list input to a workflow input. Connect the other input (the list) of your processor to a workflow input. The workflow inputs will have type of 'single item' and 'list' as the workflow inputs copy the types of the inputs they're connected to. It should be obvious that if you give this nested workflow the inputs 'A' and [a,b] it'll iterate and give you [f(A*a),f(A*b]. Also note that now the nested workflow mismatches by the same level on both inputs - it has one input with a single item type which you'll feed it a list and another of a list where you feed it a list of lists. This means you can set a dot iteration strategy over the nested workflow with the cross product (default) iteration strategy over the processor within it. This nested workflow will now produce the result you want; it will be called three times with : [A*[a,b], B*[c,d], C*[e,f]] Each one of these then creates a cross product iteration within the nested workflow, so the output is : [f(A*a),f(A*b)],[f(B*c),f(B*d)],[f(C*e),f(C*f)]] Passing the output through a list flatten operation then gives you (leaving out the 'F(x)' and replacing with 'x') : [Aa,Ab,Bc,Bd,Ce,Cf] which is what I believe you wanted? :) Adding the [1] bit in is easy from there! We actually did this exact thing some time ago for Paul, he had a structure he was viewing as two lists of directories where the lists were the same length but the directories could have any number of items in, he wanted a comparison between every item in directory 'n' from list 1 and every item in directory 'n' from list 2. Hope that helps, if you were wondering why we have a superficially pointless 'echo list' local worker now you know :) Tom",6, 0, String_Constant, create_letterListOfLists, create_capitalList, Count1, Count2, Concatenate, ,

The original research uses a selection of FLOSS project metrics to classify projects as successes or abandonments in their initial or growth phases.&nbsp; Translation of the original classification as described in the paper to a workflow analysis requires some modification of the way criteria are applied to achieve exhaustiveness. In addition, this version of the analysis parameterizes all of the classification criteria to enable exploration of different threshold values. The main aspects of the workflow that are currently incomplete are data selection and code for the classifier component. Unincorporated progress on workflow development includes&nbsp; some SQL queries for data selection and a reformulated classification criteria set.&nbsp; Assumptions include using a month unit for all time-based criteria, and restriction of classification to the six classes from the original paper.&nbsp; Desired output will be a CSV that will include all derived metrics used for classification as well as an indicator of the specific combination of metrics that results in the final classification, as there are multiple combinations of metrics that can result in any given classification.

In the analysis process, an edge weighting is applied so that older messages receive less weight using an exponential decay function; this is intended to moderate the effects of using a sliding window of observations for dynamic analysis.

This workflow uses WSDL components to select periodized data from the FLOSSmole database and generate sociomatrices. The workflow parses the threaded list structure into a communication network based on reply-to relationships.  In the analysis process, an unit weighting is applied to the edges. The weighted sociomatrices are then dichotomized according to a threshold, and their centralities are calculated using R&rsquo;s sna package, and plotted in a time series. The final output demonstrates communication centralization trends over time in a FLOSS project.  The analysis workflow allows users to set parameter values for the size of the sliding window, the date ranges covered, and the communication venues analyzed.

Is recommended use asynchronous MOBY services because the method needs huge range of time. &nbsp; <em>Short Description:</em> FunCUT  ( The workflow of the method proceeds as follows: A sequence similitary search is carried out to find proteins related to the query sequence. A clustering algorithm is applied in order to identity closely related sequence groups in the set of similar proteins. More related sequences are more likely to share a common function. In some cases, recursive sequence similitary searches lead to better representation of the related subfamilies, which facilitates the clustering. The local alignments with the closely related proteins clusteres together with the query protein are classified in different categories depending on the extent to which the alignments cover the length of the query and target sequences (alignment categories). Key functional annotations of the corresponding proteins are analyzed, including functional descriptions, enzymatic activity codes, and Swiss-Prot style keywords. The transference of information is carried out starting from the alignment categories with a better coverage. A confidence level is assigned to each one of the annotations. This level is derived from the alignment categories. The FunCUT results, as we said, includes key functional annotations of the corresponding proteins as the functional descriptions, enzymatic activity codes, and Swiss-Prot style keywords. Also, the results includes the clusters of the query protein and the hits of Blast. Created by Federico Abascal and Alfonso Valencia.

Scientiifc terms are then extracted from this text and given a weighting according to the number of terms that appear in the document.  The higher the value the better the score.This is given as: X = log((a / b) / (c / d)) where:	a = number of occurnaces of individual terms in phenotype corpusb = number of abstracts in entire phenotype corpusc = number of occurnaces of individual terms in entire pubmedd = number of articles in entire pubmed Once this has been created, the pathways obtained from the QTL and microarray pathway analysis workflows are analysed. The documents from a search of each pathway in pubmed are merged into a single document of pathway abstracts. The (unweighted) phenotype terms are then searched in the pathways corpus. This will determine if the phenotype term is listed with the given pathway.  The higher the value the better the score.Each term is then assigned a weight as: Y = log((e / f) / (c /d)) where:	a = number of occurnaces of individual terms in pathway corpusb = number of abstracts in pathway corpus (per pathway)c = number of occurnaces of individual terms in entire pubmedd = number of articles in entire pubmed The weighted terms are then given a link score. This is the total of: X + Y. This gives the link between the pathway and the phenotype a score / significance value. The higher the score the more appropriate/interesting the link between the pathway and the phenotype. The terms are also ranked according to the number of pathways which have been given a weight. This is calculated as: W = Sum( X + Y). The higher the value the better the score.",

To reduce the number of sequences returned during testing, try changing the filter on the hsapiens_gene_ensembl to the Y chromosome, or change the base pair range. I have also added control links before the start of createFasta. This is necessary due to a bug we discovered in the latest version of Taverna. This will be looked into soon &nbsp;",0, 0, ,

By analysing an actual data set (SNP detection in N. vitripennis) and translating this analysis pipeline into a Taverna workflow, I was able to come up with an easy way of using Taverna for such analysis. I created a Java API (with my limited Java experience) that wraps the command line programs used in the analysis pipeline: Bowtie and some of the SAMtools. Instead of passing Taverna or the API data, only references to files are used. The API does not have a main entry point, instead, each step in the analysis pipeline is represented by a short Beanshell script that calls the appropriate method of the API. These scripts are used as services. This workflow is part of my bachelors thesis (bioinformatics at the Hanze University Groningen, the Netherlands). Please note that Bowtie and the SAMtools need to be installed and in the path. The API needs to be present in the .taverna/lib directory, please check dependencies of the Beanshell services.

Any matches to the genes are then retrieved (abstracts only). These abstracts are then used to calculate a cosine vector space between two sets of corpora (gene and phenotype, or pathway and phenotype).   The workflow counts the number of articles in the pubmed database in which each term occurs, and identifies the total number of articles in the entire PubMed database. It also identified the total number of articles within pubmed so that a term enrichment score may be calculated.  The workflow also takes in a document containing abstracts that are related to a particular phenotype. Scientiifc terms are then extracted from this text and given a weighting according to the number of terms that appear in the document.  The higher the value the better the score.  This is given as: X = log((a / b) / (c / d))  where:	a = number of occurnaces of individual terms in phenotype corpus  	b = number of abstracts in entire phenotype corpus 	c = number of occurnaces of individual terms in entire pubmed 	d = number of articles in entire pubmed  Once this has been created, the pathways obtained from the QTL and microarray pathway analysis workflows are analysed. The documents from a search of each pathway in pubmed are merged into a single document of pathway abstracts. The (unweighted) phenotype terms are then searched in the pathways corpus. This will determine if the phenotype term is listed with the given pathway.  The higher the value the better the score. Each term is then assigned a weight as: Y = log((e / f) / (c /d))  where:	a = number of occurnaces of individual terms in pathway corpus  	b = number of abstracts in pathway corpus (per pathway) 	c = number of occurnaces of individual terms in entire pubmed 	d = number of articles in entire pubmed  The weighted terms are then given a link score. This is the total of: X + Y. This gives the link between the pathway and the phenotype a score / significance value. The higher the score the more &quot;appropriate/interesting&quot; the link between the pathway and the phenotype.  The terms are also ranked according to the number of pathways which have been given a weight. This is calculated as: W = ( X + Y). The higher the value the better the score.",1, 0, ,

If in=&quot;true&quot; then the intersection will yield a non-empty list, triggering execution of choiceA. This list will however not differ from the input, and so choiceB will iterate over an empty list (ie. not execute). Note how using 'difference' for the else-case here means that if you run the workflow with in=&quot;bob&quot;, choiceB would still run. Some early if/else workflows for Taverna 1 using Fail_if_false and conditional run would in these cases run both choices. To extend this workflow with multiple choices, add several intersections, but use String_list_Union to feed the intersected lists to list2 of String_list_difference. If no else-case is needed, simply delete String_list_difference and choiceB. The nested workflows wrap the chosen services A and B, thereby the services do not need to support receiving the token. <i>It is important to note that in this workflow 'in' is an input port at depth 0 so that only a single value is 'chosen' over the same time. If this was made depth 1, then several choices could be triggered. If you want to perform iterations over A and B (presumably taking some inputs), with individual choices, you need to wrap this workflow as a nested workflow and iterate over it.</i>",0, 0, ,

This workflow is automatic and does not require user interaction. The anatomical atlas is composed of a mean image and the set of transformations for each patient's between the mean image and the patient image. The atlas can be used to segment the mean image once and propagate the segmentation results to each patient image automatically. This workflow has been tested using GIMIAS-1.5 (open source) with a set of 10 patient images and 10 iterations. Notes: - Some thresholds are configured as fixed values. Depending on the input image, you should change these. Technical details: The spatial normalization follows the classic iterative approach presented by Guimond et al. [2]. No intensity normalization is done. For the registration, we use diffeomorphic transformations [4], which are invertible. We cannot blindly average diffeomorphic transformations; the result would not be  diffeomorphic [6]. Therefore we use Arsigny&rsquo;s log-euclidean framework [1], which makes the whole process a lot more complex [1]	Arsigny, Commowick, Pennec, Ayache. &ldquo;A log-euclidean framework for statistics on diffeomorphisms,&rdquo; Proc.

(2012, submitted), comparing proteins in the precipitate with those left in solution after organic solvent precipitation. However, the workflow is generally applicable in comparisons of any binary fractionation method in proteomics, where the fractions are analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.  The workflow identifies proteins by SpectraST spectral library search and X!Tandem database search, validates the results using PeptideProphet and combines them with InterProphet. The proteins are quantified by spectral counting and the fractions compared with respect to protein molecular weight, isoelectric point and GRAVY hydrophobicity score. In the end, an Rshell script produces the figures as presented in the manuscript.  Executing the workflow requires Rserve running and the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (",0, 0, ,

Elasticity and Sensitivity: Sensitivity and elasticity analyses are prospective analyses. 3) The sensitivity matrix: The sensitivity gives the effect on ? of changes in any entry of the matrix, including those that may, an a given context, be regarded as fixed at zero or some other value. The derivative tells what would happened to ? if aij was to change, not whether, or in what direction, or how much, aij actually change. The hypothetical results of such impossible perturbations may or may not be of interest, but they are not zero. It is up to you to decide whether they are useful (Caswell 2001). When comparing the ?-sensitivity values for all matrix elements one can find out in what element a certain increase has the biggest impact on ?. However, a 0.01 increase in a survival matrix element is hard to compare to a 0.01 increase in a reproduction matrix element, because the latter is not bound between 0 and 1 and can sometimes take high values. Increasing matrix element a14 (number of S (seedlings) the next year produced by an G (Reproductive individuals)) with 0.01 from 7.666 to 7.676 does not have a noticeable effect on ?. For comparison between matrix elements it can therefore be more insightful to look at the impact of proportional changes in elements: by what percentage does ? change if a matrix element is changed by a certain percentage? This proportional sensitivity is termed elasticity (Description based on Oostermeijer data, based on Jongejans &amp; de Kroon 2012). 4) The Elasticity matrix: The elasticities sum to 1 across the whole matrix (Caswell 1986; de Kroon et al. 1986; Mesterton-Gibbons 1993) and can be interpreted as proportional contributions of the corresponding vital rates to the matrix (see van Groenendael et al. 1994). 5) Reproductive value (v): scaled so v[1]=1. To what extent  will a plant or animal of a determinate category or stage , contribute to the ancestry of future generation. 6) The damping ratio:  it can be considered as a measure of the intrinsic resilience of the population, describing how quickly transient dynamics decay following disturbance or perturbation regardless of population structure, the larger the p, the quicker the population converges. Those statistics are function of the vital rates, and througt them of biological and environmental variables. For further details see: Caswell, H. 1986. Life cycle models for plants.

The difference file is computed from two input files (in this case present projection and 2050 projection). The difference between each corresponding raster cell value is computed and stored in the difference file, regardless of the input files&rsquo; geographical extent and origin. If the files have a different geographical extent and/or origin the raster-diff workflow automatically crops them to the same extent and resamples the values using the &ldquo;nearest neighbour&rdquo; method, resulting in a perfect cell match between the two rasters. The resulting value in the difference file ranges from the negative and positive maximum values of the input files to represent the maximum possible change in both directions. The diff result values are classified into six positive and negative classes. The predicted differences are presented for each species as a heat map, where cells with colors from green to red indicate an increase and from green to blue a decrease of predicted potential for a species. The workflow enables the computation of overall coverage, overall intensity and the difference in intensity or coverage between two raster layers. Overall coverage is computed as the percentage of raster cells with values &gt;0, and overall intensity is computed as the sum of all valued cells divided by the number of raster cells. Summary statistics for the raster layers are also provided: number of raster cells, mean intensity, median, CV, SD, Min value, Max value and number of cells outside the mask. <br /> The PNG overview will be created with these values (corresponding to the Geoserver style) Expected as input files are raster images as a URL from openModeller created by an ENM workflow. A file upload is not possible! Supported formats are: Input files with a different extent will be intersected to a common extent and the current layer (inputfile 1) will be resampled to the prediction layer (inputfile 2) using the &quot;nearest neighbor&quot; sampling method. The difference layer will be computed as inputfile_2 - inputfile_1 For working with the PSW in a own localhost an R instance should by installed on a own machine ( -------------------- This workflow has been created by the Biodiversity Virtual e-Laboratory (BioVeL",0, 0, ,

The sum layer is computed from all input files. e.g from different distribution of species as a mean value from each corresponding raster cell values, coming from the Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) Workflow ( The average sum layer computed from each corresponding raster cell values is stored together with all input layers in a multilayer stack file, regardless of the input files&rsquo; geographical extent and origin. If the files have a different geographical extent and/or origin, the raster-diff workflow automatically crop them to the same extent and resample the values using the &ldquo;nearest neighbour&rdquo; method, resulting in a perfect cell match between the two rasters. The resulting values in the average sum file depends of the value range of the input files and will be normalized to their value range. The values of the input layers and the average sum layer are classified into six positive classes. The predicted differences are presented for each species as a heat map, where cells with colors from green to red indicate an increase and from green to blue a decrease of predicted potential for a species. The workflow enables the computation of overall coverage, overall intensity and the difference in intensity or coverage between two raster layers. Overall coverage is computed as the percentage of raster cells with values &gt;0, and overall intensity is computed as the sum of all valued cells divided by the number of raster cells. Summary statistics for the raster layers are also provided: number of raster cells, mean intensity, median, CV, SD, Min value, Max value and number of cells outside the mask. The workflow contains the computation methods: - Computation of the average sum layer: - Computation of the overall coverage and intensity - Computation of the covariance and pearson matrix: - Used standard R functions: This workflow create a multilayer stack file as output and create PNG thumbnais and PNG overwiews from the input files and the average sum layer The PNG overview will be created with these values (corresponding to the Geoserver style) Expected as input files are those raster images as a URL reference e.g. output files from openModeller created by an ENM workflow. Supported formats are: Input files with a different extent will be intersected to a common extent and resampled to each other using the &quot;nearest neighbor&quot; sampling method. For working with the ESW in a own localhost an R instance should by installed on a own machine ( -------------------- This workflow has been created by the Biodiversity Virtual e-Laboratory (BioVeL",0, 0, ,
